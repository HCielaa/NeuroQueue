# NeuroQueue
This project simulates an intelligent task management system inspired by AI-based productivity tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot.

🧠 AI Task Manager
Simulating an AI-based task management system that handles user requests with prioritization, auto-retries, and live progress tracking!

🚀 Project Description
This project simulates how an AI system (like Microsoft 365 Copilot) might handle a high load of tasks coming from multiple users, manage failures, prioritize important requests, and provide live updates — all in real-time!
It uses multi-threading, priority queues, auto-retries, colored dashboards, and task logging.

🛠️ Features
⚡ Priority-based Task Management (High, Medium, Low)
🔄 Auto-retry failed tasks
📈 Real-time live dashboard (console output)
📋 Task event logging (logs.txt)
🧵 Multi-threaded architecture
🔥 Color-coded console status
🚫 Handles full queue scenarios smoothly
