## **🧠 NeuroQueue: Your AI Task Manager**
Simulating an intelligent AI-driven task management system inspired by tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot.

## **🚀 Project Description**
This project simulates how an AI system (like Microsoft 365 Copilot) might handle a high load of tasks coming from multiple users, manage failures, prioritize important requests, and provide live updates — all in real-time!
It uses multi-threading, priority queues, auto-retries, colored dashboards, and task logging.

## **🛠️ Features**
* ⚡ Priority-based Task Management (High, Medium, Low)
* 🔄 Auto-retry failed tasks
* 📈 Real-time live dashboard (console output)
* 📋 Task event logging (logs.txt)
* 🧵 Multi-threaded architecture
* 🔥 Color-coded console status
* 🚫 Handles full queue scenarios smoothly

## **⚙️ How to Run Locally**
Clone the repository:
1. git clone https://github.com/your-username/NeuroQueue.git
   cd NeuroQueue
2. Install dependencies:No extra packages needed — only Python standard libraries.
3. Run the script: NeuroQueue: Your AI Task Manager.ipynb

## **📚 Technologies Used**
* Python 3.x
* threading module
* PriorityQueue (from queue module)
* random module
* os and time libraries
* Colored console outputs (ANSI escape codes)



**🎨 Designed and developed with passion to simulate smart task management in real-world AI systems.**
